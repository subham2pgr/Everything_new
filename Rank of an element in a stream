Another approach:
Traverse the array from the beginning. While traversing, count the nodes which is equal to or less than the given key.Print the count(Rank).

// C++ program to find rank of an

#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Driver code 
int main() 
{ 
    int a[] = {5, 1, 14, 4, 15, 9, 7, 20, 11}; 
    int key = 20; 
    int arraySize = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]); 
    int count = 0; 
    for(int i = 0; i < arraySize; i++) 
    { 
        if(a[i] <= key) 
        { 
            count += 1; 
        } 
    } 
    cout << "Rank of " << key << " in stream is: "

Output:
Rank of 20 in stream is: 8
